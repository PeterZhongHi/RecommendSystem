Overview
Surprise is a Python scikit building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.
Surprise was designed with the following purposes in mind:
- Give users perfect control over their experiments. To this end, a strong emphasis is laid on documentation, which we have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every detail of the algorithms.
- Alleviate the pain of Dataset handling. Users can use both built-in datasets (Movielens, Jester), and their own custom datasets.
- Provide various ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as baseline algorithms, neighborhood methods, matrix factorization-based ( SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF), and many others. Also, various similarity measures (cosine, MSD, pearson...) are built-in.
- Make it easy to implement new algorithm ideas.
- Provide tools to evaluate, analyse and compare the algorithms performance. Cross-validation procedures can be run very easily using powerful CV iterators (inspired by scikit-learn excellent tools), as well as exhaustive search over a set of parameters.
- The name SurPRISE (roughly :) ) stands for Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine.
Please note that surprise does not support implicit ratings or content-based information.
